# Getting Started

First install Cabin and Grunt globally with the following command:
```bash
npm install -g cabin grunt-cli
```
You can then scaffold a static generator with the following command:
```bash
cabin new myBlog colinwren/Candy
```
The first parameter is the name of the destination folder, and the second is the GitHub username and repository name of a `theme` to use for the site. If the `theme` parameter is left blank, the [default theme](http://colinwren.github.io/Candy/) will be used.

After scaffolding a site generator, you can run it by entering the project directory and running `grunt` with this command:
```bash
cd myBlog && grunt
```
This will build your site, start a static file server, open a browser tab with the site's homepage, and start a watch process to rebuild your site when your source files change. Try editing or creating a new markdown file in the `posts` folder (if you are using the default theme) and upon save your site will be automatically rebuilt. When your site has been rebuilt, your browser will automatically refresh with your updated site.

# Themes
Cabin themes provide styling and structure for your static site project. They work great out of the box and as starting points for more customized sites.

## Creating Themes

### Configuration

The only file explicitly required is a `cabin.json` configuration in the root of the repo. This file describes what CSS preprocessors and template languages that your theme supports as well as the configuration for [grunt-pages](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-pages). We currently support EJS and Jade templates and the Sass and LESS style languages.

Here is an example `cabin.json` file which states that the project supports Sass, Jade, and has the specified config for the `~0.4.0` version of the grunt-pages task:
```json
{
  "style": [
    "Sass"
  ],
  "template": [
    "Jade"
  ],
  "gruntPagesVersion": "~0.4.0",
  "gruntPages": {
    "posts": {
      "src": "posts",
      "dest": "dist",
      "layout": "src/layouts/post.jade",
      "url": "blog/posts/:title/"
    }
  }
}
```
**Note: the configuration of the cabin.json must have `dist` as the destination folder and the theme files must match the folder structure described below.**

### Theme file locations

Your theme must conform to the following folder structure in order to work with the Gruntfile that Cabin generates.
```
├── README.md
├── cabin.json
├── posts
│   └── Sample posts
├── dist
│   └── Generated site files
└── src
    ├── images
    │   └── Theme image files
    ├── layouts
    │   └── Theme layout templates
    ├── pages
    │   └── Theme page templates
    └── styles
        └── Theme stylesheets
```

### Testing a theme

To test your theme, run Cabin with the `-l` flag. For example if you had a theme in a folder called `themeFolder` and you wanted to make sure it was working properly, you would run the following command to install it locally:
```bash
cabin new site themeFolder -l
```
Then you would run the following command to make sure the theme will work as expected for users once installed:
```bash
cd site && grunt
```
To see an example theme repo, check out the [default theme](https://github.com/colinwren/Candy).
